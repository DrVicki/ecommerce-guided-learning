# Full-Stack e-Commerce Store Part 2

Let's do the second part of our fullstack e-com website series. 

In this part, you'll make a node server to run your website on a localhost, then you'll learn to do form validations and storing users in firestore. In Part 2, we'll make a signup page/ login page, logout feature, and sellers dashboard.

## Code

You can see below our project's folder structure. We have some new files compared to what we had in the previous part.
